This page contains a list of people (along with their tweets) who are willing to help/mentor other programmers. I am working on a searchable index. For now, just do a Ctrl/Cmd + F and see if you can find the tech you want help with.

If you notice something wrong or want to be removed, open a GitHub issue or tweet me at [@real_ishan](https://twitter.com/real_ishan)

Thanks to [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/) who [asked people to help](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/889004724669661184)!
